# Current roadmap
### Targeted improvements
- The "Screen too small" overlay should reappear only if the viewport was resized to be big enough and then resized to be small again.
- Opening Settings shouldn't hide Pause overlay, it should still be there in background.

### Less clear improvements
- Improve the visuals of leaderboards with animations.
- Introduce score/statistics display in Zen mode.


# Future?
### Far away improvements
- Mobile mode with adapted UI and !controls!
- Skin support compatible with existing formats.
- Make vfx better.
- Replay system.
- Anti-cheat for replays.

### Just crazy ideas
- Multiplayer modes.
