# Current roadmap
### Targeted improvements
- The "Screen too small" overlay should reappear only if the viewport was resized to be big enough and then resized to be small again.
- Opening Settings shouldn't hide Pause overlay, it should still be there in background.
- Remove the now irrelevant docker configuration.

### Less clear improvements
- Improve the visuals of leaderboards with animations.
- Introduce score/statistics display in Zen mode.
- Clean up the readme.
- Clean up the agent helpers.
- Add authorization
    - Create a flow where the user doesn't have to register but they are kind of registered automatically.
    - Consider Credential Management API.
    - Untie user from username, make it unique but changeable.


# Future?
### Far away improvements
- Mobile mode with adapted UI and !controls!
- Skin support compatible with existing formats.
- Make vfx better.
- Replay system.
- Anti-cheat for replays.

### Just crazy ideas
- Multiplayer modes.
